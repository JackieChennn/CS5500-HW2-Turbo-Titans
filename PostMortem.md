# Post-Mortem
### Part 1
We finished this part first, and we didn't meet too many problems in part 1.
### Part 2
It took a while to figure out to discover how to calculate some new functions in the calculator. For example, should we use evaluate trigonometry using "degree" or "radian"? Moreover, the way a formula is evaluated in a spreadsheed is slightly different from the calculator, but everything we discussed during our meetings and figured out as a team.
### Part 3
We finished this part in three steps. First we follow the logic from our Retro-Engineering Design Artefacts, we tried to find out which file we should modify. Second step is we built the fundamental logics to enable our program to track each cell's editing username. Third step is to add more code to show the current editing username at the top left corner of each cell.
